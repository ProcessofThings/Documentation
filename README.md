# Process of Things Documention
This repository will contain all the documentation for PoT this including White Papers and Technical White Papers on the project as and when they are created.

# Get In Touch
For now we operate a Telegram group https://t.me/ProcessOfThings please feel free to join us their.

# Getting Started

This is very much in the development phase but we are trying to make it as easy as humanly posible to get started.  If you have any problems please feel free to open a issue and we will do our best to fix it as soon as possible.

# PoT

We are designing PoT to be more of a decentalised applications based around microservices allowing people to use PoT and adapt it for there own purpose.  We see decentalised applications as the way forward, leaving people incomplete control over there data and how they interact with the world around them.

# How it works

PoT is broken downs into 3 main componants Nodes, WebUI and MobileUI

Nodes are the foundation of the network, this is where all the communications is done, this is where we share information because all nodes are the same it does not matter which one your connect to.  However setting up your own node at home or in the office give you also some privacy and allow you to backup your public/private keys securly and also gives you faster access to the network.

WebUI is provided by each Node, this is used for setup and administration of your Node it can also allow you to access web service that have been created by users on the PoT network, we will introduce you the first of these which is the file management.

MobileUI are very important to the PoT network and will increasing become more useful to users.  Your mobile device is the way your interact with the world around PoT the userinterface changes based on what your are interact with while mainting your anonimity.  This means we have one app that can be used everywhere, this is know as a Mega App.

Right now until the community grows we have limited resources in both time and funding so we are going to focus on what we can do now and hope that others will see the benifit to PoT and participate in anyway they can.  So as a starting point we are currently only supporting Linux Nodes and Android with MacOS and iOS support coming in the future.  If you dont have the knowledge we are building a Education section that will help teach people what they need to know.

So basically you need to have a machine running Ubuntu 16.4 LTS or later and you must have root access.

If you dont have this you can still use PoT either via the WebUI or throught the Android App that is currently in closed Beta if you would like to test it please feel free to ask.
