# Process of Things Documention
This repository will contain all the documentation for PoT including White Papers and Technical White Papers on the project as and when they are created.

# Get In Touch
Currently the best way to get in touch with us is via our Telegram group https://t.me/ProcessOfThings please feel free to join us there.

# Getting Started

PoT is very much in the development phase,  we are trying to make it as easy as possible to get you started.  If you have any problems please feel free to open an issue and we will do our best to fix it as soon as possible.

# PoT

We are designing PoT to be a decentalised application based around microservices, allowing people to use PoT and adapt it for their own purposes.  We see decentalised applications as the way forward, leaving people in complete control over their data and how they interact with the world around them.

# How it works

PoT is broken downs into 3 main components; Nodes, WebUI and MobileUI

Nodes are the foundation of the network, this is where all the communication is done, this is where we share information, because all nodes are the same it does not matter which one you connect to.  However setting up your own node at home or in the office will give you  some privacy and allow you to backup your public/private keys securly, it would  also give you faster access to the network.

WebUI is provided by each Node, this is used for setup and administration of your Node it can also allow you to access web services that have been created by users on the PoT network, we will introduce you the first of these which is the file management.

MobileUI is very important to the PoT network and will increasingly become more useful to users.  Your mobile device is the way you interact with the world around you via PoT and the userinterface changes based on what you  interact with, whilst mainting your anonimity.  This means we have one app that can be used everywhere, this is known as a Mega App.

Right now until the community grows we have limited resources in both time and funding so we are going to focus on what we can do now and hope that others will see the benifit of PoT and participate in anyway they can.  So as a starting point we are currently only supporting Linux Nodes and Android with MacOS and iOS support coming in the future.  If you don't have the knowledge to get started but are interested we are building an Education section that will help teach people what they need to know.

So basically you need to have a machine running Ubuntu 16.4 LTS or later and you must have root access.

If you dont have this you can still use PoT either via the WebUI or throught the Android App that is currently in closed Beta if you would like to test it please feel free to ask.
