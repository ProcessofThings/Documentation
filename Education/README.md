# Process of Things Education
Here we are going to cover everything you need to get you started.  Because we want to be inclusive to everyone we will try to create everything you need. So it does not matter if you are a beginner or if you are an advanced programmer you will find everything here you need to get started.

PoT is a decentralised technology for creating an interaction between the digital world and the real world.  Using some of the latest technologies (2017) we will show you how we use the blockchain and p2p technologies to create a total decentralised technology.

The primary language we will be using is Perl, as it allows us to do rapid development. At some point in time we might expect the Open Source community help to port what has been written into whatever languages they feel most comfortable in.

The Perl Framework we will be using is Mojolicious it is easy to develop API (Application Programmable Interfaces) and with its inbuilt useragent it also allows us to interface with other 3rd Party API such as those we will use to drive the BlockChain.

# Linux

You will need a machine running Linux 64bit Machine, we do not recommend for the purpose of developing PoT that you use a virtual machine unless the host operating system is also running Linux.  At minimum, we recommed you have a dual boot machine so that you can boot.

There are many distributions our there but we recommend one of the following.  If you are new to Linux and you are coming from a windows enviroment then we recommend you start with KDE as your graphical user interface.  If you are coming from Mac then Gnome will probably suit you best.

# Mojolicious - Realtime Framework

# PerlBrew

We will be installing Perl using PerlBrew that will allow us to cross test the code with other versions of perl, and it also containerises the Perl language so its easy to duplicate its environment

# cpanm

We will be using cpanm to deploy perl modules into your enviorment this is much quicker and easier to use than the standard cpan.  Since we want to make life as easy as possible we will share some of the shortcuts along the way and cpanm is one of these.

# BlockChain - MultiChain

Because it is our intention to develop a DAO and use PoT to facilitate the management of the DAO we need to get this right, so we are going to begin the development of PoT onto MultiChain until we are happy with the logic, at that point we will develop our own blockchain with the logic built into the protocol, so we consider MultiChain a good starting point.

# IPFS

One of the other open source projects PoT will be intergrating with is IPFS. Blockchains similar to bitcoin/multichain are not good at handling large files, but  IPFS is, it is also based on blochchain technology but is designed to do distributed file handling and we will also untilse many of their p2p services.

# Where now?

Ok so you are still here, great! If you are a student we have a telegram group that you are welcome to join, here we will be teaching the ideas behind Blockchain and how to use PoT and become either a developer or learn how to build your own business around the PoT ecosystem.
